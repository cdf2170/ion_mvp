# Identity Platform - Universal Enterprise Identity Management

A revolutionary identity correlation platform that creates a single source of truth for enterprise identity management without replacing existing tools.

## 🎯 **The Problem We Solve**

Enterprise organizations struggle with **identity sprawl** across multiple systems:
- Who has access to what resources?
- Which devices belong to which users?
- Are terminated employees still accessing systems?
- What about shadow IT and unmanaged devices?

Traditional solutions force you to rip out existing tools. **We make your existing tools better.**

## 🧠 **The Solution: Hybrid Correlation**

### **API Integration Layer**
- Connects to Okta, Azure AD, CrowdStrike, Workday, etc.
- Pulls identity data from all your existing systems
- Creates canonical user identities across platforms

### **Windows Agent (Revolutionary)**
- Runs as a Windows service on each endpoint
- Reports real-time device state and user activity
- **Validates API data against ground truth**
- Detects discrepancies and missing data automatically

### **Correlation Engine**
- Matches users across systems by email, employee ID, hardware fingerprints
- Resolves data conflicts using business rules
- **Identifies gaps between API data and reality**
- Provides single dashboard with complete user/device visibility

## 🌟 **Why This Matters**

Identity sprawl costs enterprises millions in security breaches, compliance failures, and operational overhead. We're building the solution that:

- **Prevents breaches** through complete visibility
- **Ensures compliance** with automated auditing
- **Reduces costs** by optimizing existing tools
- **Saves time** for security and IT teams

**This isn't just another security tool - it's the nervous system for enterprise IT operations.**
